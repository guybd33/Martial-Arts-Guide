# Martial Arts Guide
 My final project, includes an interactive GUI, written in Python. Allows two users to record a set of  moves (punch,kick,elbow,knee), and after they done, a function compares their movements according to parameters of  time, acceleration, velocity, and angles. The moves are detected by changes of specific angles according to the user's body.
The project only works in pycharm, so to run it, you need to copy it to pycharm and perform the desired installations of the Python libraries.
An example of a video illustrating the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZfwI9rZx0
