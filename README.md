# School-for-MMA
 My final project, includes an interactive GUI, written in Python. Allows two users to record a set of  moves (punch,kick,elbow,knee), and after they done, a function compares their movements according to parameters of  time, acceleration, velocity, and angles. The moves are detected by changes of specific angles according to the user's body.
